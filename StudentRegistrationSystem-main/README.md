# StudentRegistrationSystem
Text based student registration system built for SWE 



# Compilation and Login References
Compilation is performed with g++ driver.cpp <br />
Program is run with a.out or any user specified name <br /> 
Generic Users Credentials Referenced As USERNAME | PASSWORD <br />
Generic Admin - admin | password <br />
Generic Faculty - ftestt | password2 <br />
Generic Student - jday | password <br />



# Notes
login works and passes a pointer to a user object back to driver (our main)
based on utype of current user it calls the appropriate main page
I have a mock one set up for faculty atm
